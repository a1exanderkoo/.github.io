### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because of it's amazing simplicity yet usefulness.
    I was able to convert between different units and understand the formula for how different units of the same amount was reached. Converting between units is something that is very commonly used and is very important to understand.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was another one of my favorite labs because it was another extremely simple algorithm that I could see as being immensely useful. The concept of the lab taught me how to use mathematical formulas in my functions to perform calculations with desired inputs which is very useful. Using this information, you can create functions to perform calculations using any formula as long as the formula is known.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was a very interesting lab and really opened my eyes to the fact that you can perform calculations with conditions involved as well. In a lot of situations, not all of the results from calculations are needed. Sometimes there are parameters for which results are the actual desired results; this lab taught me to apply conditions to simple functions like the 'average' function.
